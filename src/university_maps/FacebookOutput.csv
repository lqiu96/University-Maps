Syracuse University,43.040141,76.135344,#Syracuse,15932409357,URGENT: To all Bernie Sanders supporters and those thinking of supporting him guess what You may be prevented from voting for him on the critical April 19 2016 NYS Primary Why Because NYS's arcane "Tammany Hall" Election laws may disenfranchize you and many others It is all explained below Forive me the length but our "window" to get Bernie on the Ballot is only open for a few weeks longer and the information is critical So please read onI am a 60-year old ardent Bernie supporter living up in Columbia County (north of Dutchess Co) and working with our "Columbia County for Bernie" Group getting ready and set for the Primary Petition Drive beginning on 12/29 I attended SUNY Maritime and know Albany and the SUNY System well I've also spent a decade in Albany "Within the Belly of the Beast" of Inside NYS Politics dealing with the infamous "Three Men In The Room" which we now see crumbling before us My "Take-Away" based on being in those "smoke-filled back rooms": Regardless of NYS Election Law HRC (the "carpetbagger") and "Little Debbie" Wasserman Schultz have issued "do or die trying" orders to Andy Cuomo the State DEM Chair and its "Legion of Flying Monkeys" to keep Bernie off the DEM Primary Ballot AT ALL COSTS (pardon my caps)  This means pulling out every political "dirty trick" in the Book including "moles" "misinformation and disinformation agent provocateurs" the Major "Unions' Leadership" (deeply in the tank for "Billary") to bully and strongarm all union members "to tow the line" in order to thwart all of our (small "d") massive democratic efforts to legally obtain the threshold 500 (but we will aim for many more; 2500 is a number I've heard) vetted Democratic signatories by vetted Democratic volunteers in each an every Congressional District in NYS I am also a recovering attorney and have taken part as a functionary in petition and election challenges So I personally know that "Tammany Hall" is alive and well in New York as well as its undemocratic agenda I am posting here because "SUNY" is the "perfect storm" which HRC aka "Boss Tweed" is now facing "Perfect" because of the geographic dispersal of SUNY campuses across the State where other ardent Bernie supporters study and "perfect" because the "Youth" represent a critical core component of Bernie's campaign I send this almost laughable warning The "Machine" believes that the bloc which you represent is "virtual" and not "real" They think that for the most part you are mostly unregistered are highly apathetic apolitical too lazy to get involved past your keyboard and MOST IMPORTANT don't understand what it is that you have to do and the amount of energy needed to do it during this most CRITICAL month-long period begining 12/29/15 Please I know that all of you on this site "get it" It is not you that I am concerned about It is the massive number of good-hearted folk who give great "lip service" to Bernie but are cluless when it comes to understanding NYS's arcane (and IMO regressive) Election Law This is common as most New Yorkers don't understand it either But we must follow the letter (and spirit) of the law here This is why I believe that SUNY is the perfect platform to assure that The Bern gets on the Ballot Forgive me if you are all up to speed and what I'm suggesting is already in motion Now is the time using social media to contact your college friends sell them on Bernie (the easy part) make sure that they are reistered Democrats or if not registered do so immediately Organize mass transit to the County offices to register Offer to drive I should have said this earlier but make sure you work in complete coordination with the Statewide Bernie campaign and the individual "__________ County for Bernie" groups It is important for everyone to work off the same page (or lists) here and work our tremendous energy and passion efficiently like a well-oiled machine We must lock up signatures early as a "dirty trick" is for the "Flying Monkeys" to descend on a critical swing district EARLY just to steal a signature from Bernie Their machine has the numbers but not close to the energy level to do this You are guaranteed to meet them (keep someone by your vehicle to watch that the tires don't get slashedit's happened before) Senior Centers are low-hanging fruit as you can gather much with one trip Careful not to break house rules though Again coordinate with the State and County groups as the will know ALL THE RULES and where to concentrate our efforts to meet ALL the Districts' requirements Watch those great Petition gathering "workshops" videos on Internet that the Bernie people have put together specially for NYS Remember that a good chunck of time will be needed to gather all the individual petitions to vet and organize them for the Final Submission before the due deadline Again the Leaders have this all set out I'm sure that these dates and information have already been provided Remember that "Overkill" is good and may be necessary as signatories WILL be challenged Okay I'm worrying too muchbut understand that I am a child of the Sixties where it was "Bullet not Ballot" that began the mess we find ourselves in now So use your short break to start organizing what each campus cell is going to do Start to reach out to folks everywhere eapecially in the area of NY where you attend sschool Again make sure your efforts are coordinated with the Statewide Bernie Leadership This is your timethis is your "Sixties"make it happen which we failed to do decades ago So Happy Holidays and PLEASE get to work calling texting any type of social media contacting) and get perhaps our most massive and natural Bernie base up and out and make this happen  To all first time unregistered wannabe voters go to your county seat ASAP and find the office to register Democrat to be able to sign the Petition now If you first-timers plan to just vote you have a deadline of March 27 (or 29) to register as a Democrat to be able to vote in the end of April Primary (just to it NOW) So please do not be the stay at home Bernie "clicker" and play with your new electronic gizmos because that is what THEY PLAN on you doing This Quest makes "Occupy Wall Street" pale in comparison Again this is YOUR time so CARPE DIEMor "YOLO" as they say now Last please share ASAP with any other SUNY or NYS College Bernie friend or group you may know Thank you,22
